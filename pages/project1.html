	<!--Research question-->

		<h1> Research question</h1>
		<div align="center">
	<p>How can student digital course companion sites be flexible and specialized to improve user experience for BFA students in programs including the arts, film, and music?


<div class="small">  I want to explore how sites such as Canvas's design and functionality can be expanded to be suitable for students from creative fields that require more inspiration and direction in their creative process. I want to explore how visual design can enhance a user's experience through colors,images, videos, as well as providing easier communciation between student and teacher. I am interested in looking into the way these student course sites could be improved to display content in a way that is engaging and resourceful for the student.

	<h1> User survey</h1>
	<p> Have you ever faced issues using Canvas? If so, what kind of issues? </p>
	<p> As a BFA student, does viewing your assignments on Canvas inspire you to create? If not, how can Canvas showcase assignments and exercises to guide you in the creation process?</p>
	<p>Is it easy to navigate course information, assignments, and files?
	</p>
   <p>What additional tools can Canvas offer teachers to better communicate the purpose and desired outcome of assignments?</p>

	For the design ideas, I want the website/app to have allow users to view photos and videos directly from the page, without having to download the file or go through extra steps. The flexibility to attach images directly onto the page help give students a direct visual source and can allow teachers to communicate with students more efficiently.
