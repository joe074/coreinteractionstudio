		<h1> Research question</h1>
	<p>How can student digital course companion sites be flexible and specialized to improve user experience for BFA students in programs including the arts, film, and music?


<div class="small">  I am interested to see how students from creative fields navigate their courses and gather information on user experiences from students in different fields of study. I am interested in looking into the way these student course sites could be improved to include content that is exciting and resourceful for the student, as well as simple navigation.
