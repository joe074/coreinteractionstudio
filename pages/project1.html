		<br><p> Canvas Student is an educational institution platform that allows students to access their courses,calenders, class notifications, and etc. The purpose of this project is to redesign the site structure to be suitable for BFA Students of the Newschool based on the lack of visual input and limited communication between instructor and student.</p>

		<h1> Research question
		</h1>
</div>
		
	<div class="title"> How can Canvas be improved to enhance user experience for BFA students in The NewSchool? 
	</div>




<div class="small">  The student companion course will be restructured to provide students with inspiration and direction in their creative process. It is important to include visual input and provide faster access to important files and projects. The visual aesthetic can be rendered to display information in a way that is resourceful and convienient for the student.

<div class="main-headline">
	<p> Based on the Survey answers, canvas does not provide a good chat system that connects students to their teachers. It does not help in terms of creativity or craft in the earlier stages of developing an idea. </p>

<h1> Ideation</h1>
<div class='content' id='five'>
	<p>For the design ideas, I want the website/app to have allow users to view photos and videos directly from the page, without having to download the file or go through extra steps. The flexibility to attach images directly onto the page help give students a direct visual source and can allow teachers to communicate with students more efficiently. </p>
